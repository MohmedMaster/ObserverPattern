# ObserverPattern

The application starts with the table view cell, with the red and blue button. When clicked on either of the button you will be directed to a different screen depending on the button pressed (blue/red red screen). 
To test the observer pattern using NSNotification go to blue screen, then click on the observe button. Go back and click on red button the red screen will now be changed to blue screen.
